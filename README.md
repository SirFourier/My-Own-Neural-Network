# My_Own_Neural_Network
A Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network from first principles (using numpy) with variable number of hidden layers. This is tested on the MNIST dataset.

# Install and run
-  ``git clone https://github.com/SirFourier/My-Own-Neural-Network``
-  ``pip install -r requirements.txt``
-  ``python MyANN.py``

## Motivation
I wanted to have a go at creating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from first principles to better understand how it works. Therefore, I am not using machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow or PyTorch. This is so I can learn the underlying maths thats involved.
