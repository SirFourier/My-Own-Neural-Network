# My_Own_Neural_Network
A Feed Forward Artificial Neural Network from first principles.

## About
I wanted to have a go at creating an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) from first principles to better understand how it works. Therefore, I am not using machine learning libraries such as Tensorflow or PyTorch. This is so I can learn the underlying maths that goes into developing an ANN.
